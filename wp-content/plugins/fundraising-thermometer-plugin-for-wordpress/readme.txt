== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the results? =

If you would like to display the current money raised, include the following code in your WordPress theme:

<?php echo show_ourprogress() ;?>

To display the graphic results, include the following code in your theme:

<?php echo show_ourprogress_graphic();?>

= Can I include it in a Widget? =

As of 0.6.8, you will see a new widget (Appearance > Widgets) for the Our Progress graphic.

= Why can't I see any graphics? =

There are two common reasons graphics are not appearing.

Check that your wp-content/plugins/fundraising-thermometer-plugin-for-wordpress/ folder (and all subfolders) is readable (chmod 755).

Ensure the plugin folder is named fundraising-thermometer-plugin-for-wordpress, not ourprogress as in earlier versions.

= Short Codes =

In a post, you can add [show_ourprogress_graphic] or [show_ourprogress] to return the graphic file or amount donated. If you want to show the target amount in a post, use [show_ourprogress_target]

= My local currency isn't displaying correctly! =

In some cases, local currency needs to be set in the code by adding the line setlocale(LC_MONETARY, 'en_US'); immediately under the first */ for example:

Version: 0.2.5
*/
setlocale(LC_MONETARY, Ôen_USÕ);

= How do I format the numbers? =

The plugin uses standard php money_format(); formating.

= Is this plugin stable? =

Until I upgrade the version number to 1.x, I still consider this plugin to be under development but it has been tested and works well.
